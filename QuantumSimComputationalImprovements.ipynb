    "# QuantumSim - Computational Improvements\n",
    "\n",
    "Author: Wouter Pennings<br>\n",
    "Date: April 2025\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook outlines proposed improvements to the modeling approach used in QuantumSim.\n",
    "\n",
    "It focuses on addressing two primary issues:\n",
    "- Memory limitations\n",
    "- Poor performance\n",
    "\n",
    "Summary of proposed changes to QuantumSim:\n",
    "- Use of sparse matrices and efficient algorithm implementations\n",
    "- Integration of native code via JIT (Just-In-Time) compilation\n",
    "- Hardware acceleration using GPUs\n",
    "- Caching and memoization techniques\n",
    "- Lazy generation of matrices\n",
    "- Minor additional enhancements, such as:\n",
    "  - Switching the state vector to a row-based format\n",
    "\n",
    "These changes aim to significantly improve the performance of QuantumSim while maintaining the same number of qubits. They also open the door to simulating a greater number of qubits—potentially a dozen or more.\n",
    "\n",
    "Toward the end of this notebook, performance and output comparisons will be made between this improved version and the current implementation of QuantumSim.\n",
    "\n",
    "The full implementation with all proposed improvements can be found in [quantumsim_performante.py](quantumsim_performante.py).\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: The implementations presented here are not necessarily optimized. Their purpose is to demonstrate that such improvements can effectively address the identified issues. This enhanced version of QuantumSim builds upon the minimal implementation introduced in [QuantumSimIntroduction.ipynb](QuantumSimIntroduction.ipynb).\n"

    "### Sparse matrix (COO)\n",
    "\n",
    "Unitary operation matrices are mostly sparse, meaning that most elements in the matrix are zero. **Sparsity** refers to the percentage of **non-zero (NNZ) elements** in the matrix. As the number of qubits in a quantum circuit increases, the corresponding operation matrices grow larger and become increasingly sparse.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The sparsity of a matrix is defined as the percentage of NNZ elements relative to the total number of elements in the matrix.  \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider a **10×10** matrix with **7 non-zero elements (NNZ)**. The sparsity is calculated as follows:  \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{sparsity} = 100 \\times \\left( \\frac{\\text{NNZ}}{\\text{total elements}} \\right) = 100 \\times \\left( \\frac{7}{10 \\times 10} \\right) = 100 \\times 0.07 = 7\\%\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "To store these unitary matrices more efficiently by exploiting the sparsity of them. They are converted to a [sparse matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparse_matrix), these are special data structures to store sparse matrices very efficiently. There are many different types, but COO (Coordinate list) was chosen for Quantumsim. Taking a Kronecker product using the COO format is computationally extremely efficient, much better then E.G. CSR (Compressed sparse row)\n",
    "\n",
    "The sparsity of a **Hadamard operation matrix** (the least sparse unitary matrix) can be determined using the following formula, where $n$ represents the number of qubits in the circuit:  \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "f(n) = 100 \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{(n-1)}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, the amount of memory required to store a **Hadamard operation matrix** for $n$ qubits can be estimated using these formulas:  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Dense matrix:** $f(n) = 4^n \\times 16$\n",
    "- **Sparse (COO) matrix:** $f(n) = 96 \\times 2^{(n-1)}$\n",
    "\n",
    "One thing to keep in mind is that once the circuit exceeds a certain number of qubits, the unitary operation matrices cannot be converted back to dense matrices because they will be larger than the amount of memory available. This specific number of qubits depends on the system, but is generally between 13 and 16 qubits. This means that all algorithms and functions involving a unitary operation matrix should be implemented to support sparse matrices instead of dense matrices; requiring a rewrite of a large part of the entire simulation.\n",
    "\n",

    "### Sparse matrix algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that the operation matrices have been converted to sparse COO matrices, all algorithms involved have to be updated too. In addition to making the simulation work again but many possibility of many more qubits, the algorithms will also be much faster. Optimized mathematical operations such as, multiplications, transpose and kronecker, on sparse matrices are much faster than on dense matrices. The greater the sparsity greater the performance improvements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Kronecker product and matrix-vector multiplication are the only two algoriths which will need to be converted for the COO format. Why they are used in QuantumSim can be found earlier in the notebook. Scipy already provides a sparse implementation for kronecker product; [scipy.sparse.kron(A, B)](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.sparse.kron.html). This implementation from SciPy is used in QuantumSim, but will be slightly altered to make it work. Because the \"base\" unitary operation matrices are 2x2, the SciPy implementation converts them to dense matrices, but that is not what is most optimal. They have probably done this for performance reasons, but in our specific case that will not work. Below you find the altered SciPy kronecker implementation:"
